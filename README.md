# MIS
MIS (Minimal Instruction Set) is a simple project simply for the enjoyment of computer science! Its a light CPU Emulator of my own architecture "very" lightly based on RISC. It is in very ealy stages of development so bare with me as I am only a Beginner/Intermediate programmer :).

I hope you enjoy this project and feel free to collaberate and share your creations!
